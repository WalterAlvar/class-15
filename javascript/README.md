# JavaScript

In this folder you and your classmates will write your own JavaScript study guide. In Debugging you will start studying it in-depth but your learning will never be done. JavaScript is a huge and complex language. Each new module will introduce you to some new piece of JavaScript, so with each module you and your classmates should be adding new files to this directory and updating old ones.

Why write your own study guide when there are already so many out there? Because [explaining something helps you understand it](https://www.livescience.com/34000-explaining-helps-understand.html). Explanations you read or watch online will often make sense as you follow along, but when you try to give the same explanation later you realize that you miss many small details. Re-writing an explanation using code you have used in an exercise can also help master what you learned somewhere else.

## Organization

This directory will be organized with one folder for each language feature. The README for each folder will be the main introduction and the rest of the folder can contain examples, exercises, or other resources:

```
/javascript
  ...
  /variables
    /README.md
    /let-vs-const.js
    /var-and-hoisting.js
    /diagram.png
    ...
  ...
```

You and your classmates will decide what the folders should be. It's likely that after a few weeks or months you decide to _refactor_ (reorganize) the folders, that's totally ok! As your understanding of JavaScript grows, it's normal that you will find better ways of organizing your notes. Just be sure to open an issue and/or a discussion before making any big changes.

## Contributing

Everyone in your class is encouraged to contribute to this guide. There is a **JavaScript** project board in your class repository that you can use to organize your issues, pull requests, and discussions. You don't need to write a development strategy or main plan, it's better to let this folder grow naturally as you explore JS.

No contribution is too small! The only rule is that everything you put everything you are doing on the **JavaScript** project board. If you aren't comfortable writing your own study guides there's still a lot you can contribute. You can:

- help review Pull Requests
- contribute extra study references
- fix spelling or grammar mistakes
- or add your own ...

## Translations

We came from all over the world to learn together at HackYourFuture. In the same way, we all study together in english but have our own mother tongues. You are encouraged to study JavaScript in any language you prefer as long as we come together and share our learning in english. Translating from english to your mother tongue can be a good way to study, and will definitely help others who are struggling with JS!

Contributions in all languages are welcome as long as you follow these file naming conventions:

- File names should always be written in english using the same name as the english file
- File extensions should show which language they are written in (except for english which is the default)
- Files cannot be translated until there is an english version, so that everyone can share this study guide

What does this look like?

```
/javascript
  ...
  /variables
    /README.md (the main english reference)
    /README.ru.md (a russian translation)
    /README.tr.md (a turkish translation)
    ...
  ...
```
