## I'm Kate (Katia Dabrytskaya)

Now I`m happy to be a student at  HackYourFuture Belgium.
Because i like web-design and i want to make sites by myself.

I graduated from Belarus State University with a Master's degree in **Communication** and I have 8 years of work experience as Communication specialist in international companies as Carlsberg Group and Turkcell.

In Belgium i'm interested in **Web Design** (UI/Ux).
